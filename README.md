# Solvency Systems Architecture

**Goal:** Design and develop systems to increase probability of solvency over the next 60 days.

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## Executive Summary

This repository contains tool research, architecture, and roadmaps for three parallel tracks to achieve solvency:

1. **Media Production & Posting Automation** — Build attention and inbound leads
2. **SaaS Rapid Deployment** — Ship revenue-generating products quickly
3. **Portfolio Signaling** — Establish credibility through professional presence
4. **Upwork Automation** — Secure immediate income stream

---

## Three-Track Solvency Strategy

### Track 1: Media Production Engine (Attention → Inbound)
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks to full automation  
**Impact:** Medium-term (30-90 days for inbound)

**Goal:** Automated content system that builds Josh's personal brand, drives inbound inquiries, and establishes thought leadership without daily manual effort.

### Track 2: SaaS Rapid Deployment (Revenue)
**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks per product  
**Impact:** Medium-term (recurring revenue)

**Goal:** Deploy 1-2 micro-SaaS products to production with paid tiers, using Eyedentity's technical infrastructure.

### Track 3: Portfolio & Upwork (Immediate Income)
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks setup, ongoing  
**Impact:** Short-term (immediate cash flow)

**Goal:** Professional portfolio site + automated Upwork lead generation and proposal system for immediate client work.

## Quick Decisions Needed

See [QUESTIONNAIRE.md](./QUESTIONNAIRE.md) for detailed questions. Key decisions:

1. **Which track starts first?** (Recommend: Portfolio + Upwork immediate, media in parallel)
2. **Content scheduler:** Typefully vs Buffer vs custom?
3. **First SaaS product:** Which app from roadmap?
4. **Upwork focus:** Which service category to specialize in?

## Success Metrics (60 Days)

| Track | Metric | Target |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Media | Consistent posting | 2-3x/day automated |
| Media | Follower growth | +500 |
| SaaS | Products shipped | 1-2 |
| SaaS | MRR | $500-2000 |
| Portfolio | Site live | Week 1 |
| Upwork | Proposals/week | 10-20 automated |
| Upwork | Win rate | 10-20% |
| Upwork | Monthly revenue | $3000-5000 |

## Resource Allocation

**Your time (weekly):**
- Client work: 20-30 hrs (existing + Upwork)
- SaaS development: 10-15 hrs
- Content creation: 2-3 hrs (mostly automated)
- Business/admin: 2-3 hrs

**Agent swarm handles:**
- Research and monitoring
- Draft generation
- Scheduling and posting
- Upwork job scanning
- Proposal drafting
- Analytics tracking

## Next Steps

1. **Josh fills out** [QUESTIONNAIRE.md](./QUESTIONNAIRE.md)
2. **Review** [TOOL-RESEARCH.md](./TOOL-RESEARCH.md) for tool selection
3. **Finalize** [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) based on answers
4. **Delegate to FORGEs** for implementation
