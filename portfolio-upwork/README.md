- Morning scan routine (15 min)

#### 2. Proposal System
- 5 templates for common scenarios
- Claude customization per job
- Quality over quantity (10-20/week)

#### 3. CRM Tracking
- Airtable or Notion
- Track: job, proposal, response, outcome
- Analyze win rates

#### 4. Follow-up
- Manual, personalized
- 3-5 days after proposal
- Add value, don't pester
